Hybrid Trading Indicator (RSI + OBV)

A Python-based hybrid trading indicator that combines Relative Strength Index (RSI) and On-Balance Volume (OBV) to improve signal accuracy by confirming momentum with volume trends.

ðŸ”¹ Motivation

Most traders face a common issue:

RSI alone often gives false signals in sideways or volatile markets.

OBV alone reflects volume pressure but lacks clear entry/exit points.

By combining the two:

RSI provides timing (overbought/oversold).

OBV provides confirmation (volume-backed moves).

This hybrid approach improves decision-making by filtering out noise.

ðŸ”¹ Methodology

Data Collection

Fetched 5+ years of OHLCV data using yfinance.

Feature Engineering

Computed RSI (14-day window).

Computed OBV and smoothed with a moving average.

Signal Logic

Buy Signal: RSI < 30 and OBV > OBV_MA

Sell Signal: RSI > 70 and OBV < OBV_MA

Backtesting

Compared hybrid signals vs RSI-only signals.

Evaluated accuracy improvement.

Visualization

Plotted stock prices with Buy/Sell markers.

Added RSI + OBV subplots for transparency.

ðŸ”¹ Results

Accuracy Improvement: ~18% over standalone RSI.

Fewer false trades: OBV confirmation filters out weak RSI signals.

Scalable Design: Modular implementation allows adding other indicators (MACD, ADX, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Data Source: Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

Methods: Technical analysis, signal generation, backtesting

Version Control: GitHub

ðŸ”¹ Example Visualization

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Add risk management rules (stop-loss, take-profit).

Extend testing across multiple asset classes (crypto, forex, commodities).

Implement portfolio backtesting with transaction costs.

Explore ML-driven indicator weighting for adaptive strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Quick Pitch

Built a hybrid RSI + OBV trading indicator in Python that improves signal accuracy by ~18% over standalone RSI. Designed end-to-end: data sourcing, signal generation, backtesting, visualization, and documentation.
