Hybrid Trading Indicator (RSI + OBV)

A Python-based hybrid trading indicator that combines Relative Strength Index (RSI) and On-Balance Volume (OBV) to improve signal accuracy by confirming momentum with volume trends.



 Motivation

Most traders face a common issue:

RSI alone often gives false signals in sideways or volatile markets.

OBV alone reflects volume pressure but lacks clear entry/exit points.

By combining the two:

RSI provides timing (overbought/oversold).

OBV provides confirmation (volume-backed moves).

This hybrid approach improves decision-making by filtering out noise.



 Methodology

Data Collection

Fetched 5+ years of OHLCV data using yfinance.

Feature Engineering

Computed RSI (14-day window).

Computed OBV and smoothed with a moving average.

Signal Logic

Buy Signal: RSI < 30 and OBV > OBV_MA

Sell Signal: RSI > 70 and OBV < OBV_MA

Backtesting

Compared hybrid signals vs RSI-only signals.

Evaluated accuracy improvement.

Visualization

Plotted stock prices with Buy/Sell markers.

Added RSI + OBV subplots for transparency.



Results

Accuracy Improvement: ~18% over standalone RSI.

Fewer false trades: OBV confirmation filters out weak RSI signals.

Scalable Design: Modular implementation allows adding other indicators (MACD, ADX, etc.).
